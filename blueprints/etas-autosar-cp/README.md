# Model-based design workflow for AUTOSAR Classic Platform

This demo showcases how to design and test on AWS an in-vehicle application based on AUTOSAR classic platform using a model-based approach. A developer connects to his Workbench, specifically crafted for the project, via a web browser-based client with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The workbench comes will all the tools he needs to design the application, such as ETAS ASCET-DEVELOPER and EHANDBOOK-NAVIGATOR. Before committing to the project repository, he can locally execute the application at model level and verify that all the developed tests do pass. At every code commit, the project pipeline is trigged and a full suite of model-in-the-loop (MiL) tests is executed at scale. If MiL stage passes successfully, C code is generated. This code contains Application Software (ASW) and Basic Software (BSW) including the OS and the RTE. This in turn is fed into ETAS vECU-BUILDER which produces a model of the ECU in FMU format (Type-2 vECU model). At last, the vECU model is bundled with the Plant Model FMU model using ETAS COSYM. Software-in-the-loop (SiL) tests are then executed at scale with ETAS MODEL SIMULATOR, with test specifications designed with TraceTronic ECU-TEST. MiL-tests and SiL-tests reports are exposed to the workbench, where the developer can analyse them, thus closing the loop. The whole architecture can be configured and deployed via infrastructure-as-code (IaC), based on CDK and Python, and empowers anyone with an AWS account to test this workflow.

This demo aligns AWS' efforts in revolutionizingng automotive software development with ETAS' [Continuous Development Workbench](https://www.etas.com/en/products/continuous-development-workbench.php).

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

## Deploy

If you got here from the [main page](../../README.md), resume your [CloudShell session](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home#). Otherwise, please refer to the main [Getting Started](../../README.md#getting-started) section, and come back here. It will only take a few minutes.

Issue the following commands:

```sh
cd ~/asdw
./scripts/deploy etas-autosar-cp
```

The `deploy` script will take about **1 minute** to complete and will print the AWS account ID and NAT gateway address

![First deploy](./docs/output1.png)

With the above information, request access to the assets and licenses filling [**this form**](https://www.etas.com/en/portfolio/registration-continuous-development-workbench.php). ETAS will provide you access to the required tools free of charge.

When you have been granted access from ETAS, you will need to rerun the `deploy` script:

```sh
cd ~/asdw
git pull
./scripts/deploy etas-autosar-cp
```

This second `deploy` run will take about **18 minutes**. Afterwards, please allow another **10 minutes** before accessing the workbench, then click the link printed by `deploy`:

![Second deploy](./docs/output2.png)

and connect using with the following credentials:

Username: `Administrator`

Password: `Reinvent2023@`

![Access workbench](./docs/credentials.png)

The above step relies on Fleet Manager, a capability of [AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html), to connect to your workbench using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). [Fleet Manager Remote Desktop](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/fleet-rdp.html), which is powered by NICE DCV, provides a secure connectivity to a Windows Server instance directly from the Systems Manager console.

You're good to go!

## Demo Walkthrough 

1. To get started, once on the desktop, open ASCET_DEVELOPER and set the default workspace as `C:\demo_etas_git\ws`.

![Step 1](./docs/step1.png)

2. Restore the Project Explorer.

![Step 2](./docs/step2.png)

3. Navigate to `ACCSystem/ACC/ACC_SWD.bd/Main/compute` and click the `Relative_Velocity_Gain` element. Change the Default Value from **0.4** to **5**. This will make the MiL-Testing stage of the pipeline fail, stopping the execution of the following stages of the pipeline, thus saving resources.

![Step 3](./docs/step3.png)

4. Save your modifications.

5. Open Windows PowerShell.

6. Push your modifications to the repository.

```sh
cd C:/demo_etas_git/
git commit -am "changed velocity gain to 5"
git push
```

7. In the AWS Console, navigate to AWS CodePipeline, open the **project-1-dev** pipeline and you will be able to follow its execution.

8. Back on the desktop, you can also open the **Artefacts** shortcut to have a look at the artefacts generated by the pipeline. They are indexed by commit ID. Under `<COMMIT_ID>/mil-tests` you will find an `index.html` file. Right-click it and open it with Google Chrome to see the results of the failed Model-In-the-Loop tests.

9. You can now start again from step **2.** by putting back the `Relative_Velocity_Gain` Default Value to **0.4**. This will result in a successful execution of the pipeline until the SiL tests, whose results can be found again directly on the desktop under the **Artefacts** shortcut. 

## Demo Video 

Here is the re:Invent 2023 official demo video with comments on the end-to-end workflow. The underlying example (Speed Controller) is simpler than the Adaptice Cruise Controller (ACC) featured in this example. As you will not be using the Virtual Engineering Workbench, the relevant part starts at 1:40.

## Cleanup

From [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) delete `project-1-dev-software-factory` stack.
